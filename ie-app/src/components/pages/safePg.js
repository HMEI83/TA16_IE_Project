            Australia is generally a very safe and welcoming place to live and
            study, consistently ranking among the safest countries in the world.
            But it is still important to look after yourself and be aware of the
            risks that exist - and ways to minimise them. This is particularly
            important for when you first arrive and are adjusting to your new
            way of life. Following your common sense and best practices will
            ensure you remain safe and healthy, whether you are handling
            emergencies, personal and home safety, or natural elements such as
            sun, water, and fire.
