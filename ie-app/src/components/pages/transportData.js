      answer:
        <p style={{marginLeft: "-12px"}}>
          If you travel occasionally, pay as you go with myki Money. Load a dollar amount onto your myki and your myki will automatically calculate the lowest fare possible as you touch on and touch off.
          To be eligible for an iUSEpass, you need to be either
          <ol style={{marginLeft: "50px"}}>
      <li>a full-time international student</li>
      <li>enrolled in a bachelor or associate degree, diploma or advanced diploma</li>
      <li>studying at an educational institute thatâ€™s signed up to the iUSEpass program.</li>
