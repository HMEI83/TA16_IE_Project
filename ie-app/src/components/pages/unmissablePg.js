                There are countless Melbourne city attractions to enjoy and see,
                and the smartest way to go about it is by taking one of the
                amazing Melbourne walking tours! Most walking tours take you
                through the city centre.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                I recommend checking out this 2.5 hour Melbourne city tour, in
                which a knowledgeable guide will take you through Melbourne’s
                top sightseeing spots including Federation Square, Flinders
                Street Station and more!

              Being the busiest suburban railway street of the Southern Hemisphere, Flinders Street Station is, out of all the places of interest in Melbourne, a must-see!
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              While you’re at Flinders Street Station, you can admire the beautiful yellow victorian building, explore its interiors and get lost going up and down the floors. On the third floor, there is an eerie old abandoned ballroom that is, unfortunately, closed for visitors! However, you can always take a leap of faith and kindly ask an employee to let you in!
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              Finally, make sure to also check out Federation Square, which is just across the street.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>FUN FACT: Flinders Street Station opened in 1854, which made it the first railway station in an Australian city!</p>

              Melbourne is full of BIG things! For instance, Queen Victoria Market has 7 hectares and it’s the biggest open-air market in the Southern Hemisphere!
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              This market was built in the 19th century and it has since become one of the biggest Melbourne tourist attractions; it’s also a great place to get fresh produce!
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              FUN FACT: Here’s an interesting story so you can get a better image of the way Australians are: In the 1960s, the mayor of Melbourne wanted to destroy Queen Victoria Market in order to build a parking lot, but the neighbors reacted and forced him to turn the building into a national trust, so that it could never be destroyed!

              Melbourne is quite famous for its street art culture! A must see when heading to Melbourne is Hosier Lane, where you’ll always find street artists working on their pieces. You can also check out AC/DC lane and Centre place.

              On another note, you’ll find, as you’re walking around Melbourne, that there are plenty of sculptures scattered all throughout the city. Ranging from surrealist to realist, each one of these sculptures shares its own story with those passing by.

              If you are a night owl or if you simply enjoy a little night fun on your trips, Melbourne has a wide array of cool bars that you can head to! And why settle for a regular bar, when you can go to a rooftop bar? Here are my favorite ones:
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.easeys.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easey’s</a>" – go there if you want to mingle with the young crowd"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.heroesbar.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroes</a>" – for some karaoke fun"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.qthotels.com/perth/eat-drink/rooftop-at-qt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rooftop at QT</a>"  – for a more sophisticated night out"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://bombabar.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bomba</a>"  – a rooftop tapas bar, heaven!"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://thealbion.bar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albion Rooftop Bar</a>" – for a fun night out!"
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              Alternatively, you can check out the Southbank Crown Casino. In case you didn’t know this (I know I didn’t) – Australians love gambling! That’s why each city’s casino is always a big landmark and a pretty fun stop, if you gamble in moderation!

              Royal Botanic Gardens holds a place very close to my heart, as it is precisely where my brother and sister in law got married.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              Visiting the botanic gardens is one of my top things to do in Melbourne! While you’re there, you can even see the Shrine Of Remembrance, a shrine commemorating World War I!
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>If you want to visit the city and the Royal Botanic Gardens with an organized tour, I recommend this one that takes 4 hours.</p>

              PRO TIP: During the summer, you can attend one of the movie nights organized at the Royal Botanic Gardens! Admission is AU$19 – and you can even bring your own snacks and have a great picnic at the gardens!
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>NOTE: Another place to relax at is Fitzroy Gardens, just a 20 min walk from the Botanic gardens. Check out their free guided walking tour that departs from the visitor centre every Saturday at 10am!</p>

              If you’d like to see the city from up high and marvel at its breathtakingly beautiful skyline, you can visit the Eureka Skydeck on the 88th floor of the Eureka Tower! Eureka Tower is a 300m skyscraper that was built in 2006. The view from the skydeck is one of the most stunning panoramic views and photo opportunities in Melbourne – you can actually see the Dandenong Ranges National Park!
