              <p>
              While at Flinders Street Station, you can admire the beautiful yellow Victorian building, explore its interiors and get lost going up and down the floors. Also check out Federation Square, which is just across the street.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>FUN FACT: Flinders Street Station opened in 1854, which made it the first railway station in an Australian city!</p>

              Melbourne is full of BIG things! For instance, Queen Victoria Market has 7 hectares and it’s the biggest open-air market in the Southern Hemisphere!
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              This market was built in the 19th century and it has since become one of the biggest Melbourne tourist attractions; it’s also a great place to get fresh produce!

              <br></br>
              <p>
              FUN FACT: Here’s an interesting story so you can get a better image of the way Australians are: In the 1960s, the mayor of Melbourne wanted to destroy Queen Victoria Market in order to build a parking lot, but the neighbors reacted and forced him to turn the building into a national trust, so that it could never be destroyed!
